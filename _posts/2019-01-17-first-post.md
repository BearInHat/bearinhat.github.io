Hello and Welcome!

I'm started this in an attempt to get myself out there, share some ideas with the world, and learn along the way.  I'm a software guy, involved in all aspects of development.  My primary stack is SQL > C# > HTML/JS.  I'm currently working on projects using Sitecore, .Netcore, Angular, React, RabbitMQ, and Containers/Kubernetes, or to everyone not our field, "computer stuff."

Hopefully I'll have some things to share, and maybe help one person along the way.

-Bear
