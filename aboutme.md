I'm a father, husbnad, software dev, and (hopefully) a lifelong skater.  I've somehow been doing some sort of development for 11 years or so.  In the past few years I've been getting into Sitecore, and got my first developer cert ever (maybe last?) for Sitecore 8.2. At this point I'm working as a System Architect, and building out a new Sitecore site and working on a web app platform in Azure using Angular, .NET Core APIs & Services, with RabbitMQ, and Kubernetes.
